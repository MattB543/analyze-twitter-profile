From Gemini twitter analysis:

"@qwweryo  is a deeply engaged and proactive member of the rationalist, Effective  Altruist (EA), and "TPOT" (The Post-Rationality Online Thing) online  communities"

Decent guess!

The only two things that matter for crypto are surviving quantum and having AI agents use your chain, right?

If you don't survive quantum, your chain is dead
If you don't attract AI agents, then you're an economic ghost town

This seems very surprising...

When (roughly) estimating the $ cost of welfare for a year's worth of meat you get:

Pork = $1.28
Beef = $8.52
Fish = $116.83
Chicken = $141.47 (!!)

Does it seem expected that it takes 110x the money to offset chicken welfare compared to pigs? https://t.co/pxF6iXCysr (https://twitter.com/qwweryo/status/1901398323946570082/photo/1)

This confuses me...

1. OpenPhil's top AI forecaster pivoted to planning for the possibility that transformative AI is coming very soon (seems smart &amp; prudent)

2. OpenPhil ends up funding only $50M to technical AI safety research this year (&lt;1% of their total funds) https://t.co/p1UHM9ISu6 (https://twitter.com/qwweryo/status/1897771370563420603/photo/1)

Exactly... why make a superbowl ad catering to really insider takes that most people won't relate to?

OpenAI is worth ~$160B, right?

Shouldn't the nonprofit get like ~1/4 to 1/3 of that when it transitions to for-profit?

Couldn't the nonprofit immediately cash out a few billion of that and become the #1 funder/donor for AI safety in the world by far?

That post is about exiting smaller more speculative grant areas like moral worth of AI

I'd be surprised if Dustin and Good Ventures no longer care as much about AI x-risk, I just don't understand why their funding is decreasing as risks increase and timelines shorten
---
I don't understand...

@TheZvi is saying there are way more high-quality projects looking for money over previous years (and SFF can't fill it all)

Yet OpenPhil has decreased its AI x-risk funding?

The S&amp;P is up 33% over the past year, OpenPhil has billions to direct, right?
