The image features Frog holding a box while Toad gestures, illustrating a commentary on the perceived futility or impermanence of attempts to limit profit-driven motivation. The main subject is the interaction between Frog and Toad regarding the containment and subsequent potential release of "profits.")

This character stands on a bridge with hands pressed to its cheeks and mouth agape, conveying an expression of exaggerated shock or alarm.

The image depicts a businessman looking up at a glowing, winged entity composed of gears and numerous eyes, representing an AI.

This seems very surprising...

When (roughly) estimating the $ cost of welfare for a year's worth of meat you get:

Pork = $1.28
Beef = $8.52
Fish = $116.83
Chicken = $141.47 (!!)

Does it seem expected that it takes 110x the money to offset chicken welfare compared to pigs? [image](The image is a spreadsheet quantifying the estimated costs and impacts of charity interventions aimed at improving animal welfare in factory farming. Column headers include "Cost to improve welfare for one animal," "Estimated % of suffering reduced by the charity intervention," and "Estimated offset cost per year." Data is presented for various animal types, including cows (meat and dairy\), pigs, birds for meat, laying hens for eggs, fish, and crustaceans. The analysis, based on estimates from entities such as The Good Food Institute, FarmKind, Rethink Priorities, The Humane League, Fish Welfare Initiative, and Shrimp Welfare Project, highlights the varying cost-effectiveness of these interventions; for example, the "Estimated offset cost per year" ranges from $1.15 for pigs to $141.47 for birds for meat, reflecting diverse levels of suffering reduction and animal consumption per person per year.)
