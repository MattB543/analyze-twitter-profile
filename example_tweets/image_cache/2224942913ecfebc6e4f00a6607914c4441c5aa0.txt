A photograph captures a dramatic moment within a legislative chamber, focusing on a woman in a suit, Rawiri Waititi, appearing highly agitated, holding and extending pieces of paper as if tearing or discarding them, her mouth open in a shout. Another woman, Debbie Ngarewa-Packer, is visible in the foreground with her mouth agape, seemingly reacting to the scene. The core event depicts a heated exchange or protest within a parliament, where Waititi, co-leader of the MƒÅori Party in New Zealand, performed a haka and tore up parliamentary standing orders in defiance, leading to her ejection.
