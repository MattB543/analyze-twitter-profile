A screenshot displays an operator's browser attempting to answer the question: "What percent of people under 40 that live in Asheville have moved there in the past 5 years? Find enough data and sources to make sure your answer is correct." The browser shows a Stacker.com article titled "Where people Asheville are moving most," listing migration data from Florida metro areas (Orlando, Miami, Port St. Lucie) to Asheville from 2015-2019. Despite 16 minutes of work, the operator's response states, "I couldn't find specific data on the percentage of people under 40 who moved to Asheville in the past five years," offering to try different search terms.
