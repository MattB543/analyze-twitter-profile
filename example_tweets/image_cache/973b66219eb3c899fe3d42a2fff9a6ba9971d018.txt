This infographic presents an emotion wheel, systematically categorizing human feelings. At its core, the wheel identifies primary emotions such as Happy, Sad, Angry, Fearful, Bad, Surprised, and Disgusted. These central feelings then radiate outwards into increasingly specific and nuanced emotional states, such as "Joyful," "Inspired," "Lonely," "Guilty," "Frustrated," "Betrayed," and "Astonished," among many others. The image's core message is to provide a comprehensive hierarchical framework for understanding and identifying the vast spectrum of human emotions.
