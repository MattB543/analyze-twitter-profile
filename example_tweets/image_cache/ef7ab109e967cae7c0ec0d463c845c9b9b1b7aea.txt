The image is a screenshot of an article or blog post discussing the humorous "burning scientific question": "Can a three-year-old read The Hobbit?" The text states that the answer is "yeah, pretty much," introducing "Roman reading from Chapter 1." The core message is that a three-year-old, Roman, is capable of reading J.R.R. Tolkien's *The Hobbit*, as demonstrated by a direct quote of the book's opening lines: "In a hole, in the ground, there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry bare, sandy, hole, with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort."
