The image is an optical illusion, featuring two stationary, colorful rings, each with a series of circular cutouts and a central arrow. The left ring contains a right-pointing arrow (→), while the right ring displays a left-pointing arrow (←). This visual puzzle demonstrates an optical phenomenon where the static rings appear to rotate in the direction indicated by their respective central arrows when viewed in a specific manner, illustrating principles of visual motion perception.
