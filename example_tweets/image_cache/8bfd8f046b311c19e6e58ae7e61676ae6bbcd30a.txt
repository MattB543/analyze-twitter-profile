A stylized black and white graphic, likely a logo or symbolic representation, depicts a central arched or crescent-like shape, reminiscent of a rising sun or an eye, with prominent, jagged, wing-like or feather-like radiating elements extending symmetrically to either side. The graphic conveys a sense of dynamic energy, a watchful gaze, or a powerful, perhaps avian, entity in silhouette.
