A black and white line drawing depicts two simplified human figures, each with a large, fluid, and amorphous shape extending from their head that envelops them. These distinct shapes, potentially symbolizing individual thought, personal space, or perception, converge and create a shared enclosed area where the figures stand. The image visually conveys the concept of individual internal worlds that interact or overlap to form a collective or shared mental space between two people.
