The screenshot displays the Beatsync web application, showcasing a collaborative music room at "beatsync.gg/room/471127" with "3 users" and a "Synced" status, along with offset and RTT metrics. The interface presents a "Your Library" section, "AUDIO EFFECTS" including "Rotation" controls, and a "Spatial Audio" panel that explains its function: "This grid simulates a spatial audio environment. The headphone icon is a listening source. The circles represent other devices in the room. Drag the headphone icon around and hear how the volume changes on each device. Isn't it cool!" Three users are listed as "prominent-goat You," "productive-grassho... Connected," and "ambitious-ostrich Connected." The visible tracklist features titles such as "Black Coast - TRNDSTTR (Lucian Remix)," "STVCKS - Don't Be Scared," and "Illenium - Good Things Fall Apart ft. Jon Bellion." Tips for users suggest the application "Works best with multiple devices IRL in the same space" and advises to "Play on speaker directly. Don't use Bluetooth," allowing users to "Upload audio" to "Add music to queue."
