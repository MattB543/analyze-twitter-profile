An edited page from the "Frog and Toad" children's book functions as a meme, centering on the key text: "Frog put the profits in a box. 'There,' he said. 'Now we will not be motivated by profits above the cap.'" Toad responds, "'But we can open the box,' said Toad," to which Frog concedes, "'That is true,' said Frog." The image features Frog holding a box while Toad gestures, illustrating a commentary on the perceived futility or impermanence of attempts to limit profit-driven motivation. The main subject is the interaction between Frog and Toad regarding the containment and subsequent potential release of "profits."
