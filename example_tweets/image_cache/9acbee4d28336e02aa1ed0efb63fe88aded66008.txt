The "High-level Architecture of Advanced Research" diagram illustrates a multi-agent research system designed to fulfill complex user requests from a "Claude.ai chat" interface. A "User request" for a detailed list of at least 100 US companies working on AI agents in 2025, including specifics like products, descriptions, agent types, and industry verticals, is processed by a "Lead agent (orchestrator)". This orchestrator utilizes various tools, including search capabilities, memory access, and the ability to manage other subagents to complete the task. It interacts with specialized "Citations subagent" and multiple "Search subagent" components, as well as a central "Memory" store, to gather and synthesize information before delivering a comprehensive "Final report". The core message demonstrates a sophisticated AI workflow where a central agent delegates and coordinates tasks among specialized subagents to address intricate research queries.
