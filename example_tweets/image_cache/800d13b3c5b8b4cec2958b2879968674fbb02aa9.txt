The cartoon titled "The AI Revelation" features key text in a speech bubble stating, "But it only got a 92% on MMLU," followed by a caption at the bottom reading, "Yet another prophet fails to impress the quarterly review board." The image depicts a businessman looking up at a glowing, winged entity composed of gears and numerous eyes, representing an AI. The core message satirizes the corporate or academic world's focus on performance metrics, such as the MMLU benchmark, even when faced with what is presented as a profound technological "revelation" in artificial intelligence, implying that high expectations or a narrow evaluative framework can diminish perceived breakthroughs.
