A social media post by Andrej Karpathy presents a challenge to "Compose a reflective, witty poem from the viewpoint of a retired search engine reminiscing nostalgically about the early days of the internet," followed by two distinct poems, labeled A and B. Poem A begins, "I once ruled the worldâ€”well, virtually," while Poem B starts, "Oh, I recall the dial-up days." Below the poems, a poll asks, "which is better?", indicating that 29.6% prefer Poem B, 17.6% prefer Poem A, and 52.8% chose to skip or show results. The post captures a public comparison and evaluation of AI-generated poetic responses to a specific prompt.
