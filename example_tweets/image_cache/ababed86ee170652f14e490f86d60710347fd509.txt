This image is a meme designed as a modified Yin and Yang symbol, illustrating various paradoxical and cyclical states related to perceived beginnings and endings. Key text includes "it just is," "it's over," "we're so back," "it never began," "it will never end," "it's so over," and "we're back." The core message explores the constant flux between optimism and pessimism, representing the emotional journey through trends or situations where states like "being back" and "being over" are in perpetual opposition or continuum, often tied to a meta-concept of existence or non-existence. No specific entities like people, products, or organizations are depicted.
