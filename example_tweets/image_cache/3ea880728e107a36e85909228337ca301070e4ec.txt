An infographic features a graph illustrating the future distribution of work, titled "As AI capabilities rise, AI systems will be responsible for a growing fraction of relevant work." The y-axis represents the "Fraction of relevant work via AI systems & humans," ranging from 0 to 1, while the x-axis denotes "Time." The chart depicts a decreasing "Human share" of work and a correspondingly increasing "AI share," leading to a point where "AI may represent a majority of work that matters." The overarching message conveyed is that "Shaping what AI systems (can) do is among the best ways to steer towards existential security," emphasizing the critical need to guide AI development as it increasingly takes over significant tasks.
