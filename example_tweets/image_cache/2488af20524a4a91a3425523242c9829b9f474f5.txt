A screenshot of the Tubegraph web application, accessible at tubegraph.vercel.app, promotes its primary function: "Build a Knowledge Graph of Any Youtube Channel." The core message emphasizes exploring concepts, discovering connections, and thinking deeper, with example channels like Dwarkesh Podcast, Huberman Lab, and Lex Fridman showcased. The interface features input fields for adding a channel username, specifying video sorting by views, and setting a minimum video duration before generating a graph, with a section for "Graph View" indicated below and options to "CONTRIBUTE" or "EXPLORE CHANNELS." The application's logo, "Sieve," is visible in the top left.
