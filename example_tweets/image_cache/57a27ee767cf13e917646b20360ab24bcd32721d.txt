Digitally manipulated photograph depicting a surreal night scene over dark water, where a fish with an intricate, gear-like or symbolic pattern on its side leaps from the water, creating ripples. Dominating the night sky, in the position of the moon, is a glowing, circular black-and-white portrait of psychiatrist Carl Jung, towards whom the fish appears to be oriented, suggesting a conceptual or symbolic connection between Jung and the leaping fish.
