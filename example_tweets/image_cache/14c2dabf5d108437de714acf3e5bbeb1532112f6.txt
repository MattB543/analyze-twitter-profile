A promotional image for an article from PETERWILDEFOR.SUBSTACK.COM titled "The Fordow Paradox: Where do Iran and Israel go from here?" features the subtitle "How one stubborn mountain shows nuclear non-proliferation is on life support." The image is a photograph of a cityscape at night with multiple bright streaks of light across the sky, evocative of missile trails or air defense, reinforcing the urgent theme of nuclear tensions and the precarious state of non-proliferation involving Iran and Israel.
