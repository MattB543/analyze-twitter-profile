A screenshot of a digital article or blog post, dated June 15, 2025, is titled "how i bring the best out of claude code - part 1" and focuses on "1. setup requirements." The text advises users to prepare a set of requirements, ideally as issues in a repo, which can be downloaded into an `issues/` folder or integrated via GitHub with Claude code, then saved as `<issue_no>.md` files. A note within the text emphasizes that the requirements list is "very crucial" and should be treated "like a wish list for work to be done." The article further states that vague descriptions lead to undesired outcomes, recommending instructions be "as unambiguous as a program," and also suggests being aware of what the Claude model already knows.
