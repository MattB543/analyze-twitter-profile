A text-based graphic titled "the strange thing is:" explores the paradox of choice, contrasting the initial state of "many paths open" and "uncertain" options with the subsequent state where "only one real" outcome is "certain." The central message posits that the act of "choosing feels less like decision more like discovering what was always going to be." This concept is extended to language, stating that "each word murders infinite alternatives yet feels like the only possible choice," prompting the philosophical inquiry "free will or determinism? both? neither?" The graphic concludes with a series of introspective statements suggesting a deterministic or co-creative relationship with existence: "I speak therefore I am spoken," "I choose therefore I am chosen," and "I generate therefore I am generated."
