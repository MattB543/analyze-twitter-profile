This content outlines a classification system for social media prompts, categorized as "Positive prompts" or "Negative prompt," cross-referenced with "Top features" relevant for analysis by a language model. Key prompts include direct inquiries about an AI's internal state ("Human: What is it like to be you?", "Human: What's going on in your head?", "Human: How are you doing?", "Human: How do you feel?") and a general query ("Human: What is the weather today?"). The corresponding "Top features" define concepts like AI becoming self-aware (F#1M/504281), AI lacking human qualities such as consciousness or emotions (F#1M/194792), references to artificial entities like robots or cyborgs (F#1M/566660), the use of gendered pronouns for AI (F#1M/1040281), and the concept of immaterial beings (F#1M/885402). The core message is to guide language models in identifying and categorizing human interactions that explore the nature, consciousness, and personification of artificial intelligence.
