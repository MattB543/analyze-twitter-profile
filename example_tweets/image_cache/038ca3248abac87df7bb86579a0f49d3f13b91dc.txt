A social media edit history screenshot displays Jiankui He's posts and an accompanying research proposal titled "Human embryo gene editing to protect against Alzheimer's disease." Jiankui He, Ph.D., asserts his plan to "eradicate Alzheimer's disease in two years," with an earlier version of the post adding the qualifier "If allowed." The detailed proposal describes utilizing the APP A673T mutation, known to decrease Alzheimer's incidence and reduce Î²-amyloid peptides, and CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology, with testing planned for mouse models and subsequently human tripronuclear zygotes. The proposal explicitly states that no human embryos will be implanted for pregnancy and that government permits and ethical approval are required.
