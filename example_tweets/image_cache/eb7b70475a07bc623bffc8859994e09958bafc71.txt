A digital artwork creatively reimagines Edvard Munch's "The Scream," featuring a stylized, yellow, bald, emoji-like figure as the central subject. This character stands on a bridge with hands pressed to its cheeks and mouth agape, conveying an expression of exaggerated shock or alarm. The background closely mimics the iconic swirling sky and water, along with two silhouetted figures in the distance, making the image a humorous and readily identifiable pop culture parody of the original masterpiece.
