A comparative process diagram illustrates two workflows for systematic review, from "Search" to "Analysis": a "Human" process and an "otto-SR" process. The "Human" workflow involves "Reviewer 1," "Reviewer 2," and "Reviewer 3" for "Abstract Screening," "Full-text Screening," and "Data Extraction," with multiple stages of review and conflict resolution. In contrast, the "otto-SR" workflow automates these steps using "LLM" (Large Language Models), specifically "gpt-4.1" for screening based on "Study objective," "Inclusion criteria," and "Exclusion criteria," and then "o3-mini" for "Data Extraction" using "Study objective," "Variable names," and "Variable descriptions," significantly streamlining the overall systematic review process.
