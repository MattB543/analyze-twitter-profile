A screenshot from the Microsoft 365 admin center shows the successful completion of a domain setup, with the navigation path "Domains > Manage DNS" and completed steps "Connect domain" and "Finish". A large, prominent, and likely erroneous title "[object Object]" is displayed, followed by a confirmation message stating that the blacked-out domain is "all set up and you can now view and manage it from your domains list." The core message directs users to "Active users" to add new users and set up email addresses or aliases, with "Next steps" links provided for "Go to Active users" and "View all domains." A user feedback question, "Was it easy to add your domain?" is also present, offering "Yes" and "No" options.
