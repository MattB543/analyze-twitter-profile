This social media screenshot displays several X (formerly Twitter) posts. The most prominent tweet features a video of a fiery, rocket-like object against a blue sky, with Elon Musk stating "This is real" and user DogeDesigner adding "Still can't believe this is real." An X Community Note below the video asks, "How does Musk influence elections?" A separate tweet by Miles Brundage, captioned "The Soviet mind cannot comprehend this," shows a Caviar food delivery notification humorously stating, "Lenin is approaching with your order from Original Buffalo Wings." Additionally, an advertisement for RITZ Crackers suggests using their product for a "football party."
