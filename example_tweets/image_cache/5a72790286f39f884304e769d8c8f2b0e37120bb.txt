Screenshot of an online article titled "Directory of Travel Resources," published on May 27, 2025. The author, a 22-year-old computer science student from Arizona with limited travel experience and an SF/rationalist intellectual context, presents a compilation of travel advice. They note that the listed resources were "haphazardly collected" and claim them to be "more believable than an average LLM" or search engine, despite nearly all descriptions being "LLM-written" but "spot-checked" for >90% accuracy. The article invites readers to provide "high-quality resource recommendations" and features a "Table of Contents" on the right, listing categories such as "Travel Advice," "General Tips & Philosophies," "Packing Strategies," "Modalities & Styles of Travel," "Road & Air," "Walk and Talk," "Offsites," "Bicycle Touring," "Relocation / Moving Cities," "Meditation Retreats," and "Place-Specific Travel Guides" for various regions like Antarctica, Argentina, Australia & New Zealand, Austria, Bangalore, Belgium & Holland, Bhutan, Boston, Brazil, and California (state-wide). The first resource listed is "50 Years of Travel Tips" by Kevin Kelly, described as practical advice on logistics, gear, and mindset.
