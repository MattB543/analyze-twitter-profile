A social media thread from June 14, 2024, features a debate between Eric Falkenstein and Eliezer Yudkowsky regarding the independence and self-replication of AI. Eric Falkenstein states, "The critical assumption, then, is that an AI can exist w/o humans. Like the origin of life vs. evolution of amoeba to humans, the former is actually the most difficult," further asserting that "A self-replicating solar-powered thing that did not rely on humans would be a miracle. Everything is possible. Imagining it does not imply the probability is > 1e-100." Eliezer Yudkowsky responds, "Amoebas can exist without humans. Self-replicating solar-powered factories are not physically hard." The thread concludes with a comment from Quinoah reading "touch grass," and the final post shows 12.6K Views and 372 likes.
