Screenshot of a Q&A interface addressing the question of Y Combinator's investments in developer environments. The central message confirms that YC invested in WindSurf IDE via Codeium, the startup behind it, whose YC backing is well-documented. Conversely, Cursor IDE, despite its significant funding and popularity, is not a YC investment and is presented as a separate entity outside of YC's portfolio.
