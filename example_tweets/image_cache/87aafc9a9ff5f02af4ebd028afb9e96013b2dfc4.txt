The article, titled "Knowledge work is dyingâ€”welcome to the age of wisdom work," argues that AI models will render traditional knowledge-based professions obsolete by outperforming human experts in fields like physics, law, and engineering. It asserts that facts, skills, and expertise will become increasingly commoditized and replaceable, impacting over 1 billion knowledge workers such as lawyers, engineers, consultants, and programmers. The core message is that society, currently built on the premise of knowledge as a scarce resource, must adapt to an age where pure knowledge is as unnecessary as building a fire in a modern world with existing utilities like light bulbs and central heating.
