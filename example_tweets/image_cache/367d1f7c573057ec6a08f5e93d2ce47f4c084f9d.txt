The key text is "But it only got a 92% on MMLU," appearing in a speech bubble from a human figure. This is a meme-style illustration featuring a small human observing a massive, glowing, winged entity composed of numerous eyes and gears, resembling a biblical angel.

MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding) is the central benchmark mentioned.
