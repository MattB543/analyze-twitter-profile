A photograph captures a person wearing headphones engaged in live coding for music production. The on-screen code defines various sound elements and their parameters: `bassnotes` are picked from `<0 1 2 1>/4`, a `supersaw:0.0.1` waveform is distorted, and `DRUMS` are stacked from `RolandTR909`, `RolandTR808`, and `KorgMinipops` banks. `VOCALS` are sourced from a `cycles` sample, set to note `c2`, while `BASS` utilizes the `bassnotes` with the `supersaw` waveform, featuring `detune(.5)`, `unison(4)`, and specific `decay`, `release`, `sustain`, and `gain` values. Visual `_punchcard` elements indicate programmed musical patterns, highlighting the use of code to generate complex audio.
