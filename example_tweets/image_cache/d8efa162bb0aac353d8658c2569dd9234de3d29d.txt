An infographic displaying a bar chart titled "CO2 avoided by selected personal lifestyle decisions" is prominently overlaid with the message: "Individual AI use is not bad for the environment And a plea to think seriously about climate change without getting distracted." The chart compares CO2 reduction from actions such as switching to an electric car, buying green electricity, or adopting a plant-based diet, distinguishing between impacts "Not accounting for policy" and "Accounting for policy." Significantly, the chart includes "Ask ChatGPT 50,000 fewer times" as a lifestyle decision, which shows a minimal CO2 avoidance compared to other listed actions like switching to an electric car or adopting a plant-based diet, thereby underscoring the overlay text's central argument.
