"This week's helpful idea," presented by Spencer Greenberg, founder of ClearerThinking.org, identifies three ways to face any problem: Change, Reframe, or Resist. "Change" involves altering the world, situation, or oneself to solve or improve the problem. "Reframe" means viewing the problem through a healthier, happier, or more productive lens, or fully accepting it. "Resist" is defined as denying it (even to ourselves), ruminating about it, waiting for others to solve it, or ignoring it. The core message recommends aspiring to swap Resisting for Changing and Reframing.
