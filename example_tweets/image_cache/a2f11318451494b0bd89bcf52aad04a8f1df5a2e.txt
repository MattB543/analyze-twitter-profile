The image is a spreadsheet quantifying the estimated costs and impacts of charity interventions aimed at improving animal welfare in factory farming. Column headers include "Cost to improve welfare for one animal," "Estimated % of suffering reduced by the charity intervention," and "Estimated offset cost per year." Data is presented for various animal types, including cows (meat and dairy), pigs, birds for meat, laying hens for eggs, fish, and crustaceans. The analysis, based on estimates from entities such as The Good Food Institute, FarmKind, Rethink Priorities, The Humane League, Fish Welfare Initiative, and Shrimp Welfare Project, highlights the varying cost-effectiveness of these interventions; for example, the "Estimated offset cost per year" ranges from $1.15 for pigs to $141.47 for birds for meat, reflecting diverse levels of suffering reduction and animal consumption per person per year.
