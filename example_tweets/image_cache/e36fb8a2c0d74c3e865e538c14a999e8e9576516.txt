"THE WEATHER CHANGES... YET IS ALWAYS RECTANGULAR." and "ITS ESSENCE IS CLEARLY RECTANGULAR" are central textual elements in this cartoon, signed by OWEN, which features two men conversing in a setting resembling a therapy session. The image conveys a humorous and critical message about how perception can be confined by its frame, as one character observes that the weather appears rectangular when viewed through a rectangular window, with the other agreeing that its fundamental nature is rectangular, despite the non-rectangular forms of clouds and rain. The key entities are the two unnamed male characters discussing this paradoxical observation.
