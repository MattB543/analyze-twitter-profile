"Gather the smell of flowers, The taste of sugar, The feel of feathers, The sound of frogs croaking, And the memory of a paper holder from Texas, My handful of dream-dust, Not for sale." This poem by Matthew Brooks is featured on a printed page, captured in a photograph. The central message of the poem is a personal collection of invaluable sensory experiences and memories, which are not for sale.
