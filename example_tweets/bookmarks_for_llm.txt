What should I personally do if AGI timelines are short (&lt;4 years)? Here's a list of advice I commonly give to people thinking about this.

1. Form a concrete plan about what potential positions you want to be in during AGI takeoff, and how you can get there in a couple of years.

Ok, a few reflections on the book:

Since AI 2027 people have often asked us what they can do to make AGI go well. I've just published a blog post covering:

I agree with Eli that these are important areas. But IMO the most important jobs in the world probably aren't on this list, instead, they are things like:
