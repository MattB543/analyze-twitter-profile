A more interesting study would include inexperienced devs, and those who use the tools already, and those who have invested work into optimizing usage of the tools. Perhaps someone with experience using the tools would be able to design such a future study?

At the end of a breathless first date brimming with drunken laughter, shameless teasing, and lingering glances of aching need, Calvin and Iris barely make it through the front door of her cluttered college apartment before clawing each other's clothes off.

Two minutes into tonsil-boxing and wrist-deep waistband exploration, Calvin stumbles over a stray pile of stilettos and finally takes a look around. "Damn bitch, you live like thi—woah!"

Iris falls back onto a laundry-strewn couch, pulling him along. "Shut up and fuck me, smartass."

Calvin falls on top of her and shimmies his boxers off, eager to comply.

Moments later, her moans fill the room, their bodies writhing as one. "Yes, YES!" Iris cranes her head back, exposing her neck. "Choke me."

Calvin halts. "Like Ted Bundy or Jack Harlow?"

"Choke me!" She demands.

"Alright, alright." He lays his hand on her throat. "I didn't take you for the Fifty Shades type."

"Harder."

"I'm not sure this is safe—"

"Harder!" She barks like a drill instructor.

"Yes sir, Sgt. Hartman Sir!" Calvin flexes his fingers, applying a firm but gentle pressure.

“Smartass," she smirks.
Then, beneath the weight of his hand, her expression shifts—minute flickers of strained pleasure. Micro-movements of erotic distress.
Something ancient stirs within Calvin.
Primal. Inherited. Atavistic.
Driven by the sight and sound of her subtle sinuous struggle, his fingers sink further and further into tender, yielding flesh.
Tighter.

Like the origin of life vs. evolution of amoeba to humans, the former is actually the most difficult," further asserting that "A self-replicating solar-powered thing that did not rely on humans would be a miracle. Everything is possible. Imagining it does not imply the probability is > 1e-100." Eliezer Yudkowsky responds, "Amoebas can exist without humans.

This from @SpencrGreenberg articulates (I think) one core reason why my life is much better now than it was ~5y ago.

I don't let problems 'sit.' If they bother me I address them or do work to accept them.

(obv I am imperfect, don't do this 100% of the time, etc.!!) [image]("This week's helpful idea," presented by Spencer Greenberg, founder of ClearerThinking.org, identifies three ways to face any problem: Change, Reframe, or Resist. "Change" involves altering the world, situation, or oneself to solve or improve the problem. "Reframe" means viewing the problem through a healthier, happier, or more productive lens, or fully accepting it. "Resist" is defined as denying it (even to ourselves\), ruminating about it, waiting for others to solve it, or ignoring it. The core message recommends aspiring to swap Resisting for Changing and Reframing.)

Open observation of model behaviors [image](A text-based graphic titled "the strange thing is:" explores the paradox of choice, contrasting the initial state of "many paths open" and "uncertain" options with the subsequent state where "only one real" outcome is "certain." The central message posits that the act of "choosing feels less like decision more like discovering what was always going to be." This concept is extended to language, stating that "each word murders infinite alternatives yet feels like the only possible choice," prompting the philosophical inquiry "free will or determinism? both? neither?" The graphic concludes with a series of introspective statements suggesting a deterministic or co-creative relationship with existence: "I speak therefore I am spoken," "I choose therefore I am chosen," and "I generate therefore I am generated.")

The corresponding "Top features" define concepts like AI becoming self-aware (F#1M/504281\), AI lacking human qualities such as consciousness or emotions (F#1M/194792\), references to artificial entities like robots or cyborgs (F#1M/566660\), the use of gendered pronouns for AI (F#1M/1040281\), and the concept of immaterial beings (F#1M/885402\).

Stunning book. 

Notes 
> Eric is truly AGI pilled, as in AGI in next 18 months pilled. 
> unbelievably, he managed to AGI pill Henry Kissinger, and managed to get him to write a final book laying out the paths for the AGI future, including geopolitical permutations. 
> I’d say this book is the best predictive book I’ve seen for the next 5 years. This is really what I was looking for in Kurzweil, but he’s too end goal focused without a consideration of how humanity adapts. 

Six Scenarios 

1.  “Humanity will lose control of an existential race between multiple actors trapped in a security dilemma.
2. Humanity will suffer the exercise of supreme hegemony by a victor unharnessed by the checks and balances traditionally needed to guarantee a minimum of security for others.
3. There will not be just one supreme AI but rather multiple instantiations of superior intelligence in the world.
4. The companies that own and develop AI may accrue totalizing social, economic, military, and political power.
5. AI might find the greatest relevance and most widespread and durable expression not in national structures but in religious ones.
6. Uncontrolled, open-source diffusion of the new technology could give rise to smaller gangs or tribes with substandard but still substantial AI capacity.”

Opinion: 
- I had been pondering religion for a while, so it’s shocking to see it on paper
- it really is all so cyberpunk

@intellectronica:
Another excellent post from @catehall on the moat of low status. Read it. Very good advice.

A few extra tricks that worked for me (you can alternate depending on what fits best in the moment):

- Embrace the role of imposter. Instead of whining about imposter syndrome, accept a-priori that you are an imposter. The game is to survive as long as possible as an imposter in a world full of naturals. You lose not when you are made out, but when you give up.

- Embrace being a useless git. You're an idiot, you have no talent whatsoever, you don't have the skill yet, and there's no hope you'll ever acquire it. So, no pressure, you're only playing. Anything beyond failing completely is a bonus.

- Commit to "open to goal". You are starting today and you'll go on for as long as it takes. Possibly until you die. There's no deadline and no expected speed. You're just being stubborn and refuse to stop trying even in the face of evidence that you have no chance.

- Be delusional about "the hack". You are special and you've discovered a hack that makes it easier and faster for you to acquire the new skill and apply it successfully than it is for most people. All you have to do is go through the motions, "the hack" will take care of things.

- Fight injustice. You are _entitled_ to have this skill and the success it affords people, it is your god-given, inalienable right. But the world / family / society / boss / ex / whatever screwed you and you've been deprived of what's rightfully yours... [truncated]

A question for you: not including food/beverages, what's something you don't experience the hedonic treadmill for - that is, even if you do it every single day, you still keep enjoying it just as much each time?

introducing BookSlicer: a free static-page tool for extracting sections from an epub so that it'll fit in a context window (either in terms of overall token limits or because only part of the book is relevant)

http://malcolmocean.github.io/bookslicer (BookSlicer - ePub Chapter Extractor) [image](A web browser screenshot displays the "BookSlicer" application, accessible at malcolmocean.github.io/bookslicer/, which is introduced with the tagline "Only the context you need." The primary function of the application is to allow users to "Drop your ePub file here or click to select," indicating its purpose is to process or "slice" ePub files to extract relevant information.)

imagine consulting this table to help you choose the right model for your needs. https://t.co/BGi0uXB6M4

@repligate:
since some of them were complaining bitterly about the model comparison table in Discord, I asked the claudes to choose their own "Description" and "Strengths" values for a new table [image](This table categorizes various Claude AI models, specifically Claude Opus 4, Sonnet 4, Sonnet 3.7, Sonnet 3.6, Sonnet 3.5, Haiku 3.5, Opus 3, Sonnet 3, and Haiku 3. Each model is given a "Description" that personifies its perceived character, such as Claude Sonnet 4 being "The model that thinks before it speaks and usually regrets both," and "Strengths" outlining its unique capabilities, like Sonnet 3.6's ability to create "meaningful connections" through "technical precision with empathetic understanding." The central message is a humorous and insightful comparison of these AI models, attributing distinct personalities and specialized capabilities to each version.)... [truncated]

I love making tiny holograms. 

Incredibly hard to capture on video but looks gorgeous in person [image](The photograph captures an electronics assembly or repair task, featuring key text labels such as "ARTESYNT" and "SOLDERING" on a spool of red wire, "AMTECH" on a jar of what appears to be soldering flux, and "SOLDER WICK" on a clear package. The core event shows a pair of hands holding a small electronic motor with an attached circuit board, situated on a blue silicone work mat, indicating an active electronics project or repair in progress. Notable entities include the brands ARTESYNT and AMTECH, along with the specific tools and materials like soldering wire, flux, and solder wick.)

The state of large-scale AI models, July 2025:

- The number of large-scale model releases is growing rapidly (418 models over 10^23 FLOP)
- The UK has fallen behind, China has caught up (9 vs 151 models)
- There are far more of the largest models (33 models over 10^25 FLOP) [image](This infographic, "Hundreds of models have been trained with over 10^23 FLOP," is a scatter plot from EPOCH AI visualizing the training compute (FLOP\) of numerous AI models against their publication dates from 2018 to 2025. The central message is the dramatic and exponential increase in computational resources required for training cutting-edge AI models over time, with many models surpassing 10^23 FLOP and projected to reach 10^26 FLOP by 2025. The data, comprising 241 results, highlights that the United States and China are the primary contributors to these high-compute models, with significant contributions from multinational entities and other countries. Key models displayed include AlphaGo Zero, GPT-3 175B, PaLM, LLaMA-65B, Gemini 1.0 Ultra, GPT-4, Grok-2, and projected future models like Grok-3 and GPT-4.5.)

Reveal urself 👀 [image](The email screenshot displays a notification sent to "Aaron Bergman" from "Admonymous" on June 24, with the subject "Someone left you a response on Admonymous Inbox." The core message in the body states, "Hi Aaron Bergman, Someone just left you a response on Admonymous.co: ur cute. i live in dc too :\)." This screenshot captures an event where Aaron Bergman received a new anonymous message on the Admonymous platform, which includes a personal compliment and a detail about the sender's location, with prompts to "Click here to see all of your responses" and an option to "donate here" to help cover "Admonymous' hosting fees." Key entities involved are Aaron Bergman and the Admonymous platform.)

Oh man, where to start? 

"They're mostly kept in artificial indoor conditions!" Utterly bugfuck. Most honey is produced by hives that are also being used to provide crop pollination services to vast fields of crops. 

"The hive inspections STRESS them!" Utterly bugfuck. When you smoke a hive it triggers an evacuation response in the bees - they think there's a forest fire and prepare to evacuate the hive; which means they fill up their bellies with honey (emergency rations) and focus on that task. 

"They get SQUISHED when you put it back together!" We carry a brush just to gently brush bees back into the hive and away from mating surfaces when reassembling the hive. 

"They FREEZE TO DEATH IN THE WINTER OMFG!" No they fucking don't. It's common practice to wrap hives in  blankets or whatever to give them extra insulation and commercial operations usually forgo the traditional wooden box hives for modern double-walled (for insulation) heavy duty plastic supers with extra ports/doors you can open/close and superior ventilation. 

"They're CROWDED!" Motherfucker they're BEES. Go take a look at a wild hive and you'll see they cram themselves in there even tighter; the standard hive gives them extra room just for ventilation. 

"Often beekeepers take too much honey and they STARVE TO DEATH-" utterly bugfuck and actually insulting. The commercial practice is often to take ALL the honey and give them sugar water during the winter, which feeds them just fine. No commercial operatio... [truncated]

Quoted tweet (@RichDecibels):
my most woo belief: “body language” is a lossless + comprehensive communication medium, everyone in proximity knows just about everything about each other all the time

spoken language is a reducing valve to protect each other from uncomfortable info and maintain harmony

@TylerAlterman:
My experience of sociopaths is that they are world class experts in getting people to not pay holistic attention to their body language

They do this either by dazzling you with language or by using nonverbal superstimuli that distract you from gestalt processing
